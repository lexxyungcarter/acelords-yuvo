# Laravel 5 Freelance WebApp System (Yuvo)

## About This Project (Based on the magnificent and expressive Laravel Framework)

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb combination of simplicity, elegance, and innovation give you tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

I, backed by AceLords, therefore, saw an oportunity to create a feature-rich Freelance Web App to take advantage of the huge security features implemented in the system. so far, the journey has been good!

Soon the system will evolve to utilize the power of [vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and server-side rendering to take advantage of the major capabilities of building a hybrid App to go hand-in-hand with the system. It's a long journey that we can't wait to reach the destination! *fingers-crossed*

### Notes
*   The system is modular in nature, meaning you-pay-for-what-you-need. This was agreed upon by our partners to make the system more reachable, affordable and dynamic to our clientel.
*   The composer.json file contained here contains only a few of the common vendor packages used by the system. it is not to be regarded as the exact replica of the project's exact packages. The project itself utilizes ~24 free + premium packages which have intentionally been secluded due to proprietary reasons.
