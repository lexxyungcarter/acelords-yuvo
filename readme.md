# Laravel 5 Freelance WebApp System 

## About This Project (Based on Laravel)

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb combination of simplicity, elegance, and innovation give you tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

I, backed by AceLords, therefore, saw an oportunity to create a feature-rich Freelance Web App to take advantage of the huge security features implemented in the system. so far, the journey has been good!

Soon the system will integrate [vue.js](https://vue.js) to take advantage of the major capabilities of building a hybrid App to go hand-in-hand with the system. It's a long journey that we can't wait to reach the end.
